**Gustavo the spaceman** is an educational puppet kit that can help educators and teachers to teach and experiment 3D printing, electronics and coding with children. Students can customize the puppet by adding details and tools using a 3D modeling software. Then with Arduino IDE and Blockly they can program lights and sounds to create their own character. The kit is made of a 3D printed puppet with some holes for additional parts, one Arduino Nano with USB cable, a shield with 16 LEDs and 4 buttons, a small speaker and a miniSD card reader to upload sounds.
